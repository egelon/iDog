iDog is a free public database for homeless dogs in Sofia, Bulgaria. It contains photos of each dog, geographic locations of the dog's territory, information about the dog's gender and whether it is spayed/neutered or not.

This repository contains a xcode project for an iPhone app to connect to this database and query it for information, or add new dogs to it straight from the application.

Note: this app has not been published in the appstore yet. The database still needs work to make it secure and needs a web interface as well. I'll be adding more files later.
